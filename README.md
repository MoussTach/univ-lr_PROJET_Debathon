# univ-lr_PROJET_Debathon
A student project for the association CDIJ to debate

You can find three modules here, but only two are useful.

- Debathon_application
> main : <br>
>src/application/main/java/fr/univlr/debathon/application/Main.java

- Debathon_server
> main : <br>
>src/server/main/java/fr/univlr/debathon/server/Main.java

Be careful if you execute with a IDE to select the right module.

A user's manual is available at the root of this project.
